I'm a fourth year undergraduate student from [Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Tsinghua University](https://www.thu.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, representation learning, and reinforcement learning.

I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zhuowen Tu](https://pages.ucsd.edu/~ztu/) of Department of Cognitive Science, University of California, San Diego. 
You can find my CV here: [Chenru Wen's Curriculum Vitae](../assets/Resume.pdf).
